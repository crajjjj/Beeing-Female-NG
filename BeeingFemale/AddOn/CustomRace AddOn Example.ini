# This addon is to show how you can modify some BeeingFemale features for custom races.
# If you want to assign your custom baby actors to make your custom race only bears those actors, please refer to the "ChildActor AddOn Example.ini" in the same folder, or "BFACreatureChildActorsSE_ESPFE.ini" in "BFACCA_SE_Opt".
# Unless you use mods like "BFACCA_SE_Opt" or "BFASE_RSChildren_SE_Opt" to add proper child model to specific races, BeeingFemale will just copy the actorbase of the parent ("Child race determinator" in the BeeingFemale MCM determines whether the child will copy the father's actorbase or mother's actorbase).

# This is the name of this addon that will be shown in BeeingFemale MCM.
name=CustomRace AddOn Example

# This is the description of this addon that will be shown in BeeingFemale MCM.
description=(Deactivated by default as it is just an example addon) This is an example ini to show how you can modify some BeeingFemale features for custom races

# This is the author name that will be shown in BeeingFemale MCM.
author=aliceqwer3141

# Type should be ONLY one of the following three types: "misc", "race", "cme", or "global".
# Other types are not recognized in BeeingFemale system. 
# Also, designating several types (e.g., "type=misc,race") is NOT permitted as BeeingFemale cannot recognize such case.
type=race

# If you want to make sure that this addon only applies for those who install some mods, specify the necessary plugins below.
# In this example, one should install "TeraElinRace Remastered (https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/22930-teraelinrace-remastered/)" to use this addon.
# You can specify several necessary plugins, like "required=A.esp,B.esp,C.esp" and so on. 
# Each plugin name should be separated by comma (,) WITHOUT any space!
required=TeraElinRace.esm

# If you don't want this addon to be activated by default, set "enabled=false" (not case-sensitive. I.e., you can write "enabled=False").
# In the BeeingFemale MCM, one can change this setting.
# This example file is not activated by default in order to prevent conflict with other addons!
enabled=false

# If you want to hide this addon from the BeeingFemale MCM for some reason, set "hidden=true" (not case-sensitive. I.e., you can write "hidden=True").
hidden=false

# If you don't want others to modify "enabled" setting of this addon in the BeeingFemale MCM for some reason, set "locked=true" (not case-sensitive. I.e., you can write "locked=True").
locked=false

# If you want to modify N custom races individually, change the value "races" to N.
# E.g., if you want to modify 10 custom races individually, change "races=2" below to "races=10"

# If you want to modify N custom races with the same setting, change the value "races" to 1, and designate FormIDs of those N races in the "id" section separated by comma (,) WITHOUT any space.
# If you want to modify N custom races with different settings, change the value "races" to N, and designate FormID of each race in the "id" section of each "[RaceJ]" where 1 <= j <= N.
# In this example, we modify "TeraElinRace" and "TeraElinRaceVampire" with different settings, so "races=2".
races=2

#=========================================================
#=========================================================
# The first race should always begin with "[Race1]". Next race begines with "[Race2]", and so on.
# Anything NOT specified in the "[RaceN]" (N is a positive integer) will be automatically set to be the default value.
[Race1]
# This is the FormID (in hex) of the race. It should be "(Name of the plugin WITHOUT extension):(FormID WITHOUT 0x)".
# In this example, since the FormID of the "TeraElinRace" is "XX001000" in SSEEDIT (XX is the index of the "TeraElinRace.esm" in your Mod Organizer), I wrote "id=TeraElinRace:1000".
# You can specify several races, like "id=A:810,B:801,C:803" and so on. 
# Each FormID should be separated by comma (,) WITHOUT any space!
# You don't need to remove zeros in front if you are too lazy. I.e., you can write "id=TeraElinRace:001000" or "id=TeraElinRace:00001000".

# In this example, since the FormID of the "TeraElinRaceVampire" is "XX001001" in SSEEDIT (XX is the index of the "TeraElinRace.esm" in your Mod Organizer), I wrote "id=TeraElinRace:1001".
# You can specify several races, like "id=A:810,B:801,C:803" and so on. 
# Each FormID should be separated by comma (,) without any space!
