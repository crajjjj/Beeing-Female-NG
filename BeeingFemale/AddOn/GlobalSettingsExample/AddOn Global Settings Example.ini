# This addon is to show how you can modify some BeeingFemale features for EVERY races with the same settings.
# If you want to modify it for specific races, refer to the "CustomRace AddOn Example.ini" in the same directory.
# If you want to assign your custom baby actors to make your custom race only bears those actors, please refer to the "BFACreatureChildActorsSE_ESPFE.ini" in "BFACCA_SE_Opt".
# Unless you use mods like "BFACCA_SE_Opt" or "BFASE_RSChildren_SE_Opt" to add proper child model to specific races, BeeingFemale will just copy the actorbase of the parent ("Child race determinator" in the BeeingFemale MCM determines whether the child will copy the father's actorbase or mother's actorbase).

# If there are BeeingFemale features settings in the other AddOns with "type=race", those settings will override the settings in the "type=global" AddOns.
# There should be ONLY 1 AddOn ini with "type=global" in the "BeeingFemale/AddOn" folder, else settings will conflict each other!
# This is the backup file for "Global Settings.ini" in the "BeeingFemale/AddOn" folder.

# Type should be ONLY one of the following three types: "misc", "race", "cme", or "global".
# Other types are not recognized in BeeingFemale system. 
# Also, designating several types (e.g., "type=misc,race") is NOT permitted as BeeingFemale cannot recognize such case.
